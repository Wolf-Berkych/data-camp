#### Project Overview:

It is a small data science laboratory where I explore Netflix's movie dataset, focusing on movies from the 1990s. 
The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and insights in this decade's movie landscape.

1) Filtered and analyzed Netflix movies specifically from the 1990s.
2) Investigated movie durations and determined the mean, median, and most frequent movie duration.
3) Visualized the data using histograms, and calculated the height of the normal distribution.

The dataset used for this analysis is netflix_data.csv

#### Tools and Libraries

Python for scripting.
Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib for data visualization.
